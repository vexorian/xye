Executing the game
==================
After installing open a terminal and type 'xye' , you can use this command to add a desktop launcher as well.

The editor
==========
The editor should be simple to use, the less intuitive feature is to rotate objects, in the place where you select what type of object to place, you can use the mouse to rotate the object by holding the mouse button, moving it to the wanted direction and releasing the button.

Once you finish a level you might be interested to use the "save as" button to save it with another file name.

Your levels
===========
A fonder with path: "/home/username/.xye/levels" is going to be used to store the levels you make, any level in that location can also be edited later. You may share your level files in the xye google group or by sending them to vexorian@gmail.com

If there is no HOME environment variable assigned (which would be strange) then it will try to write levels at /usr/local/share/xye/levels/mylevels , which is probably read-only.

levels
======

 /home/username/.xye/levels/ might contain custom levels you make or you download.
 /usr/local/share/xye/levels/ (or a similar path) will contain the levels included in the distribution package.



xyeconf.xml
===========
 xyeconf.xml is the input file that configures xye to tell it what level of which file to play, what skin to use and even change xye's color.

 Users will need write access to this file so they can change it to their likes. And xye requires read access to it in order to listen to it.
 
 If there is a HOME environment variable in your system (which should be true for every linux distro) then xye will try to find xyeconf at /home/username/.xye/
 
 If for some reason xye can't find the xyeconf.xml at that location it will create a default one, xye also makes sure to create /home/username/.xye/ , /home/username/.xye/levels/ and /home/username/.xye/res/
 
 If there is no HOME environment variable, then it will try to find xyeconf.xml at the current directory ( ./)

 The xml structure of this file is easy to handle and edit:

 It has a unique tag , options.

options has some possible attributes:

- stufflocation : this is an important attribute, if it is present xye will ignore any other option in this xyeconf.xml file and change its current folder to the one pointed out by stufflocation. This folder requires its own xyeconf.xml (with the next options) , /levels/ and /res/ subfolders .
  Example : "/usr/share/games/xye/"

- levelfile : the location of the level file that you want to play (relative to [xye location]/levels/ )
   * if levelfile="#browse#" then it will open a level browser which is built-in xye.exe (see later sections)
- levelnumber : the number of level (optional, default is 1)
- skinfile : the skin file (relative to [xye location]/res/ ) use either "default.xml" or "classic.xml"
- red,green,blue : the RGB color for xye (optional , default is pure green)
-  undo : if this attribute is set to "yes" you can use the undo command.

 



res
===
 /home/username/.xye/res/ might contain custom skin files and sprites.
 /usr/local/share/xye/res/ (or a similar path) will contain the original skin files and sprites.

Executing xye
=============

* open a terminal window

* If you used make install, use xye

* Otherwise go to the /xyelocation/ and there type ./xye ./

* Distributions may allow better ways to execute xye, for example Nautilus will execute xye by just double clicking on the xye executable file when you are in the [xye_location] folder, and you can also create a desktop icon and that stuff yourself, it is up to your desktop/distribution.


Gameplay
========
For controls and other gameplay instructions check out the GAMEINTRO.txt file


More
====

 It is possible to make new skins for the game, check out the default.xml and classic.xml in the res subfolder, you require an editor with the capability of making PNG graphics with transparency.


Charity
=======
  Kye was a charityware, although Xye targets to be completelly free software, it is fair to add these lines to the readme: if you really enjoy this game and want to give me a good reason to continue improving it. Instead of asking for donations I am gonna ask you to donate to any Children Charity. If you do it BECAUSE OF XYE, and feel like making the authors feel better, email me at vexorian@gmail.com to tell me you did it :) (do not include any private information/proof as that is risky, just tell me you donated to charity because you enjoyed Xye)
